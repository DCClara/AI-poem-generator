          <h3>Béchamel Sauce</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1¼ cups whole milk, heated</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Step 1</h4>
          <p>
            Warm the milk on low heat until little bubbles form at the edges;
            remove from heat.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 2</h4>
          <p>
            Melt 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over
            medium heat. Stir in 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour and cook, stirring
            constantly, until the paste cooks and bubbles a bit, but don't let
            it brown, about 2 minutes. Slowly add 1¼ cups whole milk, heated,
            whisking to incorporate. Bring it to a boil, stirring constantly, as
            sauce thickens. Add kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to
            taste. Reduce to low heat, and cook, stirring, 2–3 minutes more.
            Remove from the heat.
          </p>

          <p>
            Do ahead: To cool this sauce for later use, cover it with wax paper
            or pour a layer of milk over it to prevent a skin from forming.
            Refrigerate for up to 3 days.
